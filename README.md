# object-oriented
This repo contains programs that display my knowledge and abilities with Object-Oriented programming using Python.
Each of these assignments were assigned during my Object-Oriented Programming class at Rutgers University.

To see what each assignment covers, go into the folder and view the pdf that explains what each problem is
asking. All of my solutions are correct and have been tested for its effectiveness and efficiency.
